Our team introduces a new method for detecting objects called YOLO. The traditional method of object detection involves reusing classifiers for the task. However, we treat object detection as a regression problem and use spatially separated bounding boxes and class probabilities. YOLO utilizes a single neural network to predict these directly from full images, allowing the entire detection pipeline to be optimized end-to-end. Our architecture is highly efficient, with the base YOLO model processing images at a rate of 45 frames per second in real-time. Even the smaller version of the network, Fast YOLO, processes an impressive 155 frames per second and achieves twice the mAP of other real-time detectors. While YOLO does make more localization errors than some state-of-the-art detection systems, it is less likely to make false positive predictions on background. YOLO also learns more general object representations and performs better than other detection methods when generalizing to other domains, such as artwork.
