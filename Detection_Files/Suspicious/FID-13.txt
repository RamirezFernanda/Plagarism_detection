For a long time, machine learning has been employed in high energy physics (HEP), especially at the analysis level with supervised categorization. In the early 1980s, quantum computing was proposed as a technique to execute computations that would be impossible to perform on a conventional computer. With the introduction of noisy intermediate-scale quantum computing systems, more quantum algorithms are being created with the goal of utilizing the hardware's potential for machine learning applications. An intriguing subject is whether quantum machine learning can be used to HEP. This paper examines the first generation of concepts that employ quantum machine learning on HEP problems and forecasts future applications.
