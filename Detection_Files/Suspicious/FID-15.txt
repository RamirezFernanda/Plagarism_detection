We propose a deep convolutional neural network architecture called Inception, which was responsible for establishing the new state of the art for classification and detection in the ImageNet Large-Scale Visual Recognition Challenge 2014 (ILSVRC14). The key point of this architecture is the most efficient use of computing resources within the network. This was achieved through a careful design that allows the depth and width of the network to be increased while keeping the computational budget constant. To optimize quality, architectural decisions were based on the Hebbian principle and the insight of multiscale processing. One particular incarnation used in our presentation for ILSVRC14 is called GoogLeNet, a 22-layer-deep network, the quality of which is evaluated in the context of classification and detection.
