Machine learning has revolutionized areas such as vision and translation, and is now increasingly being used in science, where correcting such code is vital. Python is popular for machine learning, partly due to its large number of machine learning libraries, and it is considered to speed up development; however, this dynamic language has less support for error detection at code time than tools like Eclipse. This is especially problematic for machine learning: Given its statistical nature, code with subtle errors can run and produce results that seem plausible but don't make sense. This can vitiate scientific results. We report on Ariadne: Applying a static framework, WALA, to machine learning code using TensorFlow. We've created static analysis for Python, a type system to track tensors (the core data structures of Tensorflow), and dataflow analysis to track usage. We present how it was built, as well as some preliminary results.
