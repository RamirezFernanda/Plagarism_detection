This study is concerned with paraphrase detection, or detecting semantically equivalent sentences. Text mining, text summarization, plagiarism detection, authorship verification, and question answering all rely on the capacity to recognise similar words written in natural language. Recognizing its significance, we investigate how to solve the issues associated with recognizing paraphrases in user-generated short messages, such as Twitter, which frequently contain language irregularity and noise and do not always contain as much semantic information as lengthy clean texts. We provide a unique deep neural network-based strategy based on coarse-grained phrase modeling with a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a recurrent neural network (RNN) model, paired with a fine-grained word-level similarity matching model. More specifically, we create a new architecture called DeepPara that allows us to create an informative semantic representation of each sentence by (1) extracting local region information from the sentence in the form of important n-grams and (2) applying RNN to capture long-term dependency information. Furthermore, we conduct a comparative study on state-of-the-art approaches in paranoid detection. An noteworthy finding from this study is that while existing paraphrasing techniques work well on clean texts, they do not always perform well on noisy texts, and vice versa. In contrast, our evaluation revealed that the suggested DeepPara-based approach outperforms the previous approaches in both types of texts, making it more resilient and versatile.
