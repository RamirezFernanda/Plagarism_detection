Machine learning (ML) and cloud computing are two subjects that mix very well. The existence of cloud computing enables data scientists to create their machine learning models with the benefits of cloud computing which are very low cost, high performance, and high availability. This opens a new opportunity of allowing students and other people to utilize powerful machines for daily use with the help of appropriate cloud service. On the other hand, machine learning is usually perfect for recognizing patterns in our daily life. This article discusses the possibility and the benefit of creating a user-friendly general-purpose pattern recognition that can be played around by anyone using software as a service.
