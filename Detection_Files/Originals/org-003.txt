Modern education relies heavily on educational technology, which provides students with unique learning experiences and enhances their ability to learn. The use of technology in education has been around for a long time. However, compared to other educational levels, the incorporation of digital learning in early education is a much more recent trend. As a result, there is a pressing need to design, implement and study particular methods and resources for the education of young children. These days, AI and ML are two of the most promising areas of application in the world of Information Technology, where the potential application breadth is virtually limitless Researchers and scientists are currently particularly interested in the applying machine learning in education, and this is the primary emphasis of our work. Using AI and machine learning (ML) in the classroom is the focus of this study. An easy-to-use yet set of tools for classification jobs is provided by Google Teachable Machines, powered by convolution neural network ( cnn. Even low-end mobile devices can run the taught machine learning models, and the applications can be used even with these devices.
