Belief merging has received much attention from the research community with a large range of applications in Computer Science and Artificial Inteligence. In this paper, we represent a new belief merging approach for prioritized belief bases. The main idea of this method is to use two operators, namely connective strong operator and averagely increasing operator to merge possibilistic belief bases. By this way, the proposed method allows to keep more useful beliefs, which may be lost in other methods because of drowning effect. The logical properties of merging result are also analyzed and discussed.
