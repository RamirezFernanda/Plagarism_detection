The use of artificial intelligence methodologies in a variety of real-world applications has been around for some time. However, the application of such methodologies to thermal science and engineering is relatively new, but is receiving ever-increasing attention in the published literature since the mid 1990s. Such attention is due essentially to special requirements and needs of the field of thermal science and Engineering (TSE) in terms of its increasing complexity and the recognition that it is not feasible to approach many critical problems in this field by the use of traditional analysis. The purpose of the present brief review is to point out the recent advances in the artificial intelligence (AI) field and the successes of such methodologies to the current problems in thermal science and engineering. Some shortfalls and prospect for future applications will also be indicated.
