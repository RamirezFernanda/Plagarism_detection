Video analytics is an integral part of surveillance cameras. Com-pared to video analytics, audio analytics offers several benefits, including less expensive equipment and upkeep expenses. Additionally, the volume of the audio datastream is substantially lower than the video camera datas-tream, especially concerning real-time operating systems, which makes it less demanding of the data channel's bandwidth needs. For instance, automatic live video streaming from the site of an explosion and gunshot to the police console using audio analytics technologies would be exceedingly helpful for urban surveillance. Technologies for audio analytics may also be used to analyze video recordings and identify occurrences. This research proposed a deep learning model based on the combination of convolutional neural network (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN) known as the CNN-RNN approach. The proposed model focused on automatically identifying pulse sounds that indicate critical situations in audio sources. The algorithm's accuracy ranged from 95% to 81% when classifying noises from incidents, including gunshots, explosions, shattered glass, sirens, cries, and dog barking. The proposed approach can be applied to provide security for citizens in open and closed locations, like stadiums, underground areas, shopping malls, and other places.
